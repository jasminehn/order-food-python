# üçî McDonald's Python Ordering Service
This simple Python program simulates placing an order from the McDonald's menu. It was created as a final project to conclude a programming language blog I was tasked with writing for my CS class. The assignment was to pick a language that I was not well versed in and teach it to myself throughout the course of the semester. I was to post weekly for at least 7 weeks with information related to a given topic provided by the professor. 

Here is a link to the blog: [Python Language Blog](https://pythonlanguageblog.blogspot.com/)
